# Encryptext

## About

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/WhenLifeHandsYouLemons/Encryptext/releases).

Encryptext can do what Notepad does, and more. You can edit, format, and encrypt files securely, while also editing regular text files with ease.

## Features

Encryptext can open a muiltitude of file types such as, but not limited to:

1. `.txt`
2. `.py`
3. `.css`
4. `.html`
5. `.js`
6. `.etx`

`.etx` files are encrypted text files that can only be opened by Encryptext. They are encrypted using an encryption algorithm that is extremely secure. The encryption key for each user is unique and never the same for each user. This adds an extra layer of encryption for your files.

**IMPORTANT**: `.etx` files created by your copy of the program can only be opened and be readable using the same copy of the program.

`.etx` files also allow you to format the document with ease. You can change the font (being added in the future), font size, font color, and font style - such as bold and italic - of the document.
