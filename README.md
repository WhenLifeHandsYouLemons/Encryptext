# Encryptext

## About

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/WhenLifeHandsYouLemons/Encryptext/releases).

Encryptext can do what Notepad does, and more. You can edit, format, and encrypt files securely, while also editing regular text files with ease.

## Installation

1. Go to "<https://github.com/WhenLifeHandsYouLemons/Encryptext/releases>" to download the "`Encryptext.zip`" file from the latest release.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Run the "`installer.exe`" file.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen.
5. Run the "`Encryptext.exe`" file to get started!

## Features

Encryptext can open a multitude of file types such as, but not limited to:

1. `.txt`
2. `.py`
3. `.css`
4. `.html`
5. `.js`
6. `.etx`

`.etx` files are encrypted text files that can only be opened by Encryptext. They are encrypted using an encryption algorithm that is extremely secure. The encryption key for each user is never the same as any other user. This adds an extra layer of encryption for your files.

**IMPORTANT**: `.etx` files created by your copy of the program can only be opened and be readable using the same copy of the program.

`.etx` files also allow you to format the document with ease. You can change the font (being added in the future), font size, font color, and font style - such as bold and italic - of the document.
